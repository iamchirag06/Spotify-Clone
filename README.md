# Spotify Clone

A web-based Spotify Clone that mimics the functionality of Spotify, allowing users to browse albums, play songs, and view individual song details with cover images.

## Features
- **Album Browsing**: View a collection of albums with their cover images and descriptions.
- **Now-Playing Section**: Displays the currently playing song with a large, centered cover image, title, and artist information.
- **Song-Specific Cover Images**: Each song is displayed with its own cover image in the playlist.
- **Dynamic Updates**: The Now-Playing section dynamically updates whenever a new song or album is selected.
- **Responsive Design**: Designed to work across various device sizes.

## Usage
